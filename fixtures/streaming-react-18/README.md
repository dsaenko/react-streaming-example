# Streaming react-18 fixture

## Setup

```
cd fixtures/streaming-react-18
yarn
yarn start
```

The `start` command runs a webpack dev server and a server-side rendering server in development mode with hot reloading.

**Note: whenever you make changes to React and rebuild it, you need to re-run `yarn` in this folder:**

```
yarn
```

If you want to try the production mode instead run:

```
yarn start:prod
```

This will pre-build all static resources and then start a server-side rendering HTTP server that hosts the React app and service the static resources (without hot reloading).
